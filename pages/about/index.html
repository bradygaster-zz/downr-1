		<p class="number-one">
			The most important thing to know about me as a developer, 
			and human is that I act accordingly.
		</p>

		<p>
			I care about the type and quality of work, I'm putting out intro the word.
			It's important that I belive in the motivations and goals of the projects.
			I've plenty of practical skills and experience, but the quality of
			carring is what makes a great developer.
		</p>

		<p class="programming">
			Programming is a means to an end. I've ideas and want to see them
			come to life. I use code to make these ideas to reality.
			I push my self to learn new languages, frameworks, platforms and practicies.
			No language is off limits and I don't shy away from learning difficult
			concepts. Development technologies are in constant flux and love it.

	<h3>About This Site</h3>
	
	<p>
		I staked my claim on this piece of Internet property in 2012. Since then I’ve maintained this site as my portfolio and blog.
		No CMS was harmed during the making of this site. I decided early on that it just wasn't necessary. Instead, all of the pages of this site are good ole' HTML, CSS and a bit of Javascript.
		For a web server I decided to try something new and give NGINX a go. I really enjoy working with it. I find configuration to be much more straight-forward than Apache, and it just feels lighter and faster.
