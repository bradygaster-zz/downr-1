		<p class="number-one">
			The most important thing to know about me as a developer, 
			and human is that I act accordingly.
		</p>

		<p>
			I care about the type and quality of work, I'm putting out intro the word.
			It's important that I belive in the motivations and goals of the projects.
			I've plenty of practical skills and experience, but the quality of
			carring is what makes a great developer.
		</p>

		<p class="programming">
			Programming is a means to an end. I've ideas and want to see them
			come to life. I use code to make these ideas to reality.
			I push my self to learn new languages, frameworks, platforms and practicies.
			No language is off limits and I don't shy away from learning difficult
			concepts. Development technologies are in constant flux and love it.
