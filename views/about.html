        <p class="intro">
            The most important thing to know about me as a developer, 
            and human is that I act accordingly.
        </p>
        <p class="i-care">
            I care about the type and quality of work, I'm putting out intro the word.
            It's important that I belive in the motivations and goals of the projects.
            I've plenty of practical skills and experience, but the quality of
            carring is what makes a great developer.
        </p>
        <p class="programming">
            Programming is a means to an end. I've ideas and want to see them
            come to life. I use code to make these ideas to reality.
            I push my self to learn new languages, frameworks, platforms and practicies.
            No language is off limits and I don't shy away from learning difficult
            concepts. Development technologies are in constant flux and love it.
